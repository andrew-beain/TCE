# TCE - Tiny Computer Emulator

(Basically it's an intel 8086 emulator):

 * Great for students and hobbyists to learn basic computer architecture 
 * Wonderful for people interested in the demoscene
 * Expandable live memory and register viewer for rapid debugging (eventually)

Runs out of the box!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jdolandev/TCE.git
cd TCE
g++ -o TCE tce.cpp -Wall -std=c++11
```

### Enjoy!
